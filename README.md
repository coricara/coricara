- 👋 Hi, I’m @coricara

- 👀 I’m interested in AI (because why not) and in learning everything about how tech works and have a taste of as much of it as i can,
-  when i have a broader view and understanding of all the gears involved in making this engine run,
-  i'll be able to make a better informed decision on which part of it to pursue.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning app developement, i started with Dart/Flutter which probably most would argue is a bad start, but it is what it is.. 😅.
- I am using Firebase for the backend of my first app, so i think that means i still don't know anything about backend.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything i can be of help on or that could help me in my journey,
- i love discovering and learning new things, so if you think you can help me with any of that, i would really apreciate it if you hit me up.

- 📫 How to reach me .. dm me? is there such a feature on GitHub? Idk or email me at coricara7@gmail.com
